"""House voice linter — the book's counters, pointed at product copy.

    python3 tools/voice_lint.py src/app/mastering-allyship/page.tsx
    python3 tools/voice_lint.py "src/**/*.tsx" --strict     # exit 1 on a hard hit
    python3 tools/voice_lint.py README.md -v                # every site

Self-contained on purpose: standard library only, no repo layout assumed, no config
file. Drop it anywhere and it runs.

## What this is, and what it deliberately is not

This is the portable half of `instruments/review.py` from the book repo. That instrument
runs twelve steps against `manuscript/ch*.md` and knows about marginalia membranes,
chapter registers and a typeset spine. **None of that exists in a product repo**, so
porting it whole would ship a tool that mostly reports about files it cannot find.

What ports is the part that is about English: the hard gate, and the density counters.
The regexes below are **copied verbatim** from `gate.py`, `prose_diet.py` and
`empty_head.py` so the site and the book cannot drift into disagreeing about what a
defect is. When the book's counters change, re-copy them; do not re-derive them.

## Reading TSX without linting the code

A marketing page is 90% code and 10% copy, and running an English linter over the code
produces noise that trains you to skim — the failure every counter in the book repo had
to be narrowed out of. So for `.ts/.tsx/.js/.jsx` this extracts only what a customer can
read:

  - JSX text nodes — the characters between `>` and `<`
  - string and template literals that look like prose

"Looks like prose" means: contains a space, contains a lowercase letter, is at least 12
characters, and does not look like a class list, an import path, a URL, a CSS value or an
identifier. **The coverage line in the report says how much was actually scanned**, so a
clean board on 40 characters is visibly a clean board on 40 characters.

Markdown and plain text are read whole.

## Tiers

**HARD** — the gate. Banned words, sentence-initial And/But, glued em-dashes, negation
stacks, live placeholders, narrating the reader's history back to her as fact, and
**fragments**. Each one is a defect rather than an opinion. `--strict` exits 1 on any.

**The fragment check is the one addition to the ported gate, made 2026-09-01**, and it is
the only rule here that is a heuristic rather than a pattern. It exists because the
constraint it enforces used to have an exception — a fragment was legal if it carried a
*beat* — and the exception was revoked for being gameable: prose gets more rhythmic in
order to qualify for it. A rule with no exception can be checked, so this checks it.

Sentences with no finite verb, at most twelve words, outside headings, table cells and
list items. Imperatives are complete sentences and are allowed; so are sentences opening
with an unambiguous subject pronoun. **What it cannot do is separate a main clause from a
subordinate one**: *Sixty cards, every one a question you send a friend* is a fragment,
and the `send` inside the relative clause hides it. Catching that needs a parser, and
this file is standard library only by design. **The limit is stated rather than left to
be found.**

**SOFT** — the densities, per thousand words, against the book's own measured baselines.
These are *candidate finders*. A number over the baseline means read the sites; it does
not mean the sentence is wrong. Marketing copy legitimately runs hotter than book prose
on `copula` and `waste` — a landing page points at things.

# ------------------------------------------------- FRAGMENTS (constraint, not a counter)
#
# Added 2026-09-01, on Wendell's ruling. The constraint used to read "fragments carry
# beats, never claims, and only in landing position" and it was revoked for cause: an
# exception clause gets used as a licence. Given a rule that permits a fragment when it
# carries a beat, prose bends toward sounding rhythmic in order to qualify. The rule now
# has no exception, so it can be checked.
#
# There is no parser here on purpose — this file is stdlib-only and stays that way. The
# test is a heuristic: a short sentence with no finite verb in it. That catches the shape
# that actually recurs (a noun phrase punctuated as a sentence) and it will occasionally
# be wrong, which is why the report names the sentence and not just a span.
#
# What is deliberately NOT scanned: headings, table cells and list items. A bullet list of
# noun phrases is a list, not prose, and nobody has ever thought it needed a finite verb.
# Blockquotes ARE scanned, with the marker stripped, because that is where drafts live.
