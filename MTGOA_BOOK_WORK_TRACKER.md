### Chapter-by-Chapter Coverage (TEAL manuscript)
| Chapter | Face | Coverage | Gaps |
|---------|------|----------|------|
| Ch 1+ | Shaman | ✅ Strong | Could add Body Vote move |

- [ ] Create chapter structure document in manuscript folder

### Phase 2: Gaps (Weeks 2-3)
- [ ] Write Big Mind Voices chapter
- [ ] Write Fred Taxonomy chapter  
- [ ] Add Vibeulons to book (as emotional currency system)
- [ ] Deepen Regent (Amber) tooling — add 3 concrete moves

### Phase 3: Sage & Integration (Week 4)

- [ ] Write Chapter 7 (Integration)
- [ ] Connect to BARs Engine (works-inspired quests)
- [ ] Final pass: ensure every chapter has 3-5 named moves with practices

### Phase 4: Companion Workbook (Post-manuscript)
- [ ] Map "works that inspired" quests to book chapters
- [ ] Create companion exercises for each chapter
- [ ] Build the Vibeulon tracking system into book

## ❓ Open Questions (from I Ching analysis below)
1. Do we want a "Chapter 0" (Infinite Arcade / Entering the Game) or fold it into Chapter 1?
2. Does each Face chapter get its own emotional channel breakdown OR is the 5-channel system a standalone chapter?
3. Do we want I Ching references embedded in each chapter (meta-game layer)?
4. The "works that inspired" quests — companion workbook OR fold into appendices?

## 🚨 Open Action Items (terminology / disambiguation)

### WAVE acronym collision — **resolved 2026-04-20**
**Created:** 2026-04-16
**Surface:** `CHAPTER2_SHAMAN_FULL_DRAFT.md` § "Scenario 1: 10-Second WAVE" (line ~323)

The acronym **WAVE** is currently being used for two distinct frameworks in the body of work:

| | WAVE-Spiral | WAVE-Somatic |
|---|---|---|
| **Stands for** | Wake Up → Clean Up → Grow Up → Show Up | Welcome → Acknowledge → Validate (your body's right to feel this) → Exhale (keep if useful, exhale to the sea if not) |
| **Domain** | Integral / bars-engine emotional alchemy ontology | In-the-moment somatic technique (in-conversation, in-body) |
| **Timescale** | Seconds → days (full integration arc) | 1–10 seconds (real-time regulation) |
| **What it produces** | A canonical Move (transcend / generative translate / control translate) | A regulated body that can then run a Move |
| **Source** | `bars-engine/.agent/context/emotional-alchemy-ontology.md` | Author's somatic practice lineage |

**Why this matters:**
- Chapter 2 currently teaches WAVE-Spiral as the framework, then introduces "10-Second WAVE" as a quick-application of it. But by the author's actual usage, the *somatic* WAVE is the one designed to operate on a 10-second timescale. The chapter is implicitly conflating them.
- Reader will hit a contradiction the moment they encounter the somatic WAVE elsewhere (existing teaching material, workshops, podcast, Igniting Joy lineage).

**Resolution options to choose between:**
1. **Rename one of them.** E.g., keep WAVE for the developmental sequence; rename the somatic technique (WAVES? W.A.V.E.? "the Welcome practice"? "Body-WAVE"?). Or vice-versa.
2. **Nest them.** Treat somatic-WAVE as the *body protocol* that runs *inside* Wake (stage 1 of spiral-WAVE). Same letters, two altitudes — explicitly named.
3. **Disambiguate by suffix.** WAVE-Integral and WAVE-Somatic, or "Big WAVE" / "Little WAVE."
4. **Keep the collision intentional** — argue they're the same shape at different timescales (fractal), and teach them as such.

**Decision owner:** Author (Wendell)
**Blocks:** Finalizing Ch 2 § Practice; the other 5 Face chapters (template propagation)
**Inline marker placed:** `CHAPTER2_SHAMAN_FULL_DRAFT.md` line ~323 (TODO comment)

**Decision (2026-04-20):** Nested + suffix disambiguation.
- `WAVE-Spiral` = Wake Up -> Clean Up -> Grow Up -> Show Up (macro practice loop).
- `WAVE-Somatic` = Welcome -> Acknowledge -> Validate -> Exhale (micro regulation protocol).
- Integration rule: `WAVE-Somatic` runs inside Wake Up when regulation is needed before meaning/action.
- Editorial rule: first mention per section must include suffix (`-Developmental` or `-Somatic`).
- Status: Locked (unblocks Ch2 practice section + template propagation).

## OUT OF SCOPE — Future: Zo.space Book Hosting

**Idea:** Host draft chapters in zo.space so collaborators can review inline, leave comments, react. Shareable public links per chapter. Enables async editorial review without file attachments.

**Why powerful:**
- Public links for beta readers / collaborators
- Inline reaction possible
- Doesn't require Google Docs or email
- Separates "draft for review" from "final manuscript"

**Current blocker:** Still need to write chapters first. Not a priority until we have complete drafts for all 7.

**Action:** When all 7 chapters are drafted, revisit this. Create a zo.space route per chapter or a single `/book` route with chapter links.
