prose_diet.py — the three grammar moves, measured.

Named 2026-07-29 after they were caught by eye in the W7 rewrites: leaning on
"is", on "it" without a clear antecedent, and on articles fronting nominalized
verbs. All three are ways of sounding like a sentence without committing to one,
and all three are nearly invisible one line at a time.

Implements the diagnostics four editors converge on:

  Lanham, *Revising Prose* — the Paramedic Method. Box the be-verbs, circle the
  prepositions, then ask "who is kicking whom?" and put the doer in the subject.
  Be-verbs are where the action went missing.

  Williams, *Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace* — subjects should name
  characters, verbs should name their actions. When the action hides in a noun,
  turn the noun back into a verb. Williams licenses nominalization in four
  cases, which is why this is a candidate finder and not a gate.

  Sword, *The Writer's Diet* — five categories, three of which are these:
  be-verbs, zombie nouns, and the waste words *it / this / that / there*. Her
  rule for the last: use "it" and "this" only when you can state exactly which
  noun each refers to.

  Vague-pronoun-reference doctrine — search the draft for it/this/which/that,
  draw an arrow to the antecedent, and rewrite anything with no arrow.

**Thresholds are this book's own baseline, not absolute standards.** The
manuscript is written; the job is to stop new prose drifting heavier than the
prose around it. A chapter at the book average scores 1.00.

# INCHOATIVE, added 2026-08-02. Wendell, on a sentence of mine that had just passed
# `gate` clean and scored 0.46 on copula: "What does 'go careful' mean? In which way are
# we now using the go, went construction as a way to be passive in a way that seems
# active?"
#
# `go/goes/went/gone` + adjective is an inchoative copula: it means *become*, and
# `goes cold` unpacks to `is cold now`. It has the surface shape of an intransitive
# action verb — subject, verb of motion, no object — so the eye reads it as something
# happening. Nothing happens. A state gets reported, and with an inanimate subject
# nobody caused the state, which makes this the same defect as `the hum arrives` and
# `it shows up` wearing a costume that reads as active.
#
# **BE and COPULA are structurally blind to it.** Both patterns match only
# is|are|was|were|be|been|being. Measured on two files of otherwise identical sentences:
#
#     "The meeting goes cold. The table goes careful."     be 0.00   copula 0.00
#     "The meeting is cold.  The table is careful."        be 4.97   copula 3.44
#
# So driving `copula` down actively rewards moving copulas into `go`, which is the same
# dynamic that made EMPTY necessary when driving `waste` down pushed pronouns into empty
# nouns. Third time this shape of hole has been found; assume there is a fourth.
#
# A CANDIDATE FINDER, like AGENT. The construction is legal with a human subject —
# `you go cold` at ch2:358 is the Emotional Body freezing, and the involuntariness is
# the whole point of the sentence. It is a defect when the subject cannot act. The
# counter scores only the inanimate ones; `-v` prints both, with the subject it found,
# because the classifier is a heuristic and only a reader can rule the edge cases.
#
# The adjective list is drawn from the manuscript's own usage rather than from a
# dictionary. Add to it when a new one is caught by eye — that is how the last three
# counters in this file grew.
