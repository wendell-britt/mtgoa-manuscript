## Draft mode, added 2026-08-29

This file was written on 2026-08-01 because Wendell said *"we are REALLY bad at this 'it'
thing… this needs to be a pattern to explore the book against."* On 2026-08-29 he caught
the same defect again, in marketing copy the pass had reported clean — *"the meeting where
the same person absorbs it again"*, and: **"what person? what is it? We're handwaving
again."**

**The pattern was explored against the book, exactly as asked, and never against a draft.**
It had no FILE branch, so it read the manuscript whatever you passed it. See
`specs/GAP_DRAFT_REVIEW_INSTRUMENTS_2026-08-29.md`.

**One class of hit is louder on a draft than in the book, and it is left in deliberately.**
A paragraph-opening `This` or `It` pointing at the artifact itself — *"This is a field
guide"*, *"Skip it if you are looking for a script"* — has no antecedent inside the
paragraph, so it reports as an orphan. In a chapter the paragraph before it supplies a
noun; on a 500-word description there is no paragraph before it. **That is a real question
about copy a reader arrives at cold** — *this* what? — and suppressing the class would also
hide the handwaves it is here to find. Three glances on a draft is the price.

## Why this exists

Wendell, 2026-08-01, on a drafted line of mine reading *"I have been on the other
side of it more times than I can count"*:

> *"Been on the other side of what? We are REALLY bad at this 'it' thing. So much so
> that this needs to be a pattern to explore the book against. These pronouns aren't
> operating correctly. In this case the 'it' is the thing that someone wrote on a
> card, but it's too far away from its pronoun, and so it reads as confusing."*

A pronoun fails two ways, and both are countable without a coreference parser.

**Distance.** The referent is far enough back that the reader has to go looking.
Working memory for an unrepeated noun is short.

**Paragraph crossing.** No candidate appears anywhere in the paragraph before the
pronoun, so the referent is back in a previous paragraph. That is the failure
Wendell caught: the noun and its pronoun were separated by a paragraph break, and by
the time the pronoun arrived the reader had put the noun down.

## How it is measured

For each referential `it`, `this`, `that`, `they` and `them`, the instrument walks
back through the paragraph collecting candidate antecedents (common and proper
nouns, matched for number where the pronoun marks it), and reports the distance in
words to the nearest one.

**CORRECTED on the first run.** The first version also scored *competition* — how
many other nouns sat in a two-sentence window. That metric fired on 2,436 sites,
including *"Most of the people held to it have no professional training in it"*,
where the referent is two words back and perfectly clear. Ordinary prose has many
nouns near any pronoun; counting them measures prose, not confusion. The tier was
removed rather than tuned, because no threshold on it separates the clear cases from
the unclear ones.

**Expletive `it` is excluded** — *it is worth*, *it turns out*, *it takes three
hours*. That `it` refers to nothing and needs no antecedent, and counting it would
bury the real hits. The exclusion is a pattern match and it is imperfect; a hit list
this instrument prints is a candidate list.

## What this is not

It is not a coreference resolver. It cannot tell you what the pronoun points at, and
it will flag pronouns that a reader follows without effort because the referent is
the obvious topic of the passage. What it can do is find every place where the
grammar gives the reader more than one plausible answer, which is the half a person
cannot do by reading their own prose — the writer always knows what they meant.
