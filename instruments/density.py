Propositional idea density — why a book can score easy and read hard.

## The finding this exists to correct

`instruments/readability.py` reported the book at Flesch-Kincaid 7.2 and concluded
it was three grades *easier* than Wendell's own control text. Wendell's reading
experience is the opposite: the book is hard, "because of how the sentences make
people's minds work."

Both are true, and the second one is the one that matters. Kintsch and Keenan
showed in 1973 that **the number of propositions in a sentence, rather than the
number of words, determines reading time.** Every formula in `readability.py`
counts words and syllables. None of them counts propositions. So a text can be
built out of short, plain, one-syllable sentences and still be expensive to read,
because each of those sentences carries a full proposition the reader has to
build, and they arrive one after another with no connective telling her how they
join.

That is a description of this manuscript's register.

## What is measured

**Propositional idea density (P-density)**, in the sense of Kintsch (1974) and
Turner and Greene (1977), approximated from part-of-speech tags the way Brown,
Snodgrass, Kemper, Herman and Covington's CPIDR does it: the count of verbs,
adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and conjunctions over total words. Ordinary
English prose sits near 0.5. Higher means more ideas per word, which means more
work per word.

**The interaction, which is the actual finding.** Density and brevity are not
independent problems. A twenty-word sentence at 0.5 gives the reader room to
assemble ten propositions. A six-word sentence at 0.6 hands her four propositions
with no subordination to say how they relate, and then does it again. This
computes density *within each sentence-length band*, because the band is where
the cost lands.

**Given-new.** A sentence whose opening carries no content word from the sentence
before it starts on new information, and the reader has nothing to attach it to.
Halliday's theme/rheme, Williams' topic position. Counted per paragraph.

## The control is Wendell's own

`specs/VOICE_ANCHOR.md` holds five passages he selected as the book at its best
(DL-14). They are the right comparison set: not another author, not a formula's
idea of easy, but this book's prose in the places its author says it works.
