## Why this exists

Wendell, 2026-09-01, reading the proof: *"That is the trade, every time. THAT IS THAT IS THAT
IS."* And then the diagnosis, in full:

> *"That is the trade points to nothing the reader can hold onto. They have to move backwards to
> remember what it's referring to. Using the definite article* the *in* the trade *assumes there
> is a trade that people know about AND it's supporting something they have to reference back to
> understand… These are telling instead of showing, which is my big critique of the writing time
> and time again."*

**The construction is a copula carrying a label the reader cannot hold.** *That is the trade.*
*Encouragement is the smaller word.* *It is the kind you carry home.* Two failures ride in it:

- **The demonstrative points backward.** *That* sends the reader in reverse to rebuild the
  referent, so the sentence hands over nothing to hold moving forward.
- **The definite article presupposes.** *the trade* claims a trade the reader already knows,
  when nothing has named one. *The* smuggles in a shared thing that does not exist, then leans
  on it.

**It breaks Strunk twice.** Rule 18 — the end of a sentence should carry *"the new element in
the sentence"* — and a re-label carries nothing new. Rule 11 — *direct and vigorous* — dies on
the flat copula.

## The remediation is not a better sentence

Wendell, on how he fixes one: *"If the reader is making a trade we need to use language that
puts them in a place where the trading is happening and they see the result of the trade they've
made. And feel the dissatisfaction. What it's leaving out is that it's a bad trade. Most people
don't talk about good trades. It flags that the thought is unfinished."*

**So a copula-label is a symptom of unfinished thinking.** The writer reached for the label
because the scene, the mechanism, and the consequence were not worked out yet. **The fix is to
finish the thought** — put the reader where the thing happens, let them see the result and feel
it — not to tighten the label. And the label usually hides a verdict: *trade* means a *bad*
trade, and showing it lets the reader feel the bad deal the label flattened.

## Three tiers, by how much they mean

**LABEL** — a demonstrative or *it* + a copula + an article + a noun. *That is the trade.* The
flagship, and the one to drive down. **3.0% of the book's sentences; 7.3% in the flagged proof
passage.** Reported as a rate against the book, HEAVY over it.

**PROPERTY** — an abstract handed a physical property. *praise has a shape*, *a texture to it*.
**Five in the whole book**, which is why one of them stopped Wendell cold. A low-noise
candidate: the off-system copula-metaphor, the *is* that walked into a mapping the reader cannot
make (Lakoff, *Metaphors We Live By*, not Strunk).

**ABSOLUTE** — an asserted universal, *every time*, *always*. A separate sickness from the
copula: a claim that has to be proven and dies on the first exception, the one Wendell named. It
appears in **302 sentences across the book**, and the instrument surfaces every one. **Whether a given
absolute is earned or unprovable is a reading call — not the instrument's, and not mine.** The
pattern also catches bounded factual uses (*never once wondered* = a thing the narrator did not
do), which it cannot mechanically separate from unearned universals. Both reach the reader as
candidates. Nobody upstream of the reader gets to clear them.

## What it cannot decide

Whether a copula is deliberate. This book's ontology spends *is* on purpose — *allyship is a
game*, the psyche as an arcade, the self as a party of characters — the licensed metaphors of
`Metaphors We Live By`. The instrument cannot tell a licensed *is* from an accidental one.
**It reports candidates and a rate.** The test a reader applies to each: does it show or tell,
is the metaphor on-system, and is the thought under it finished.
